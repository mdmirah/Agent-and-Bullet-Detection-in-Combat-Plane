<h1 align="center">Agent and Bullet Detection in Combat: Plane</h1>

This repository provides custom functions for detecting agents and bullets within the Combat: Plane environment, a multi-agent air combat simulation used in reinforcement learning research. The utilities are designed to extract positional and interaction data from raw image frames, enabling the design of custom heuristics and reward structures.
